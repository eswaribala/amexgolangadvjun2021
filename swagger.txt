Generate Swagger documentation
Let us divide this whole process of API documentation into 3 steps:

Adding annotations in code
Generating Swagger specs (swagger.json and swagger.yaml)
Serving the Swagger UI using the specs generated in the previous step

 Generate swagger.json
Once we are done annotating our main method and all the APIs, we shall generate the swagger docs with the swag init command, as below:

# In your project dir (~/GOPATH/src/swaggo-orders-api normally)
swag init -g main.go
